# Installation

JLoop is currently distributed as standalone JARs through the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Rabbit-Town-Software/jloop/releases).  
You can include it in your project in several ways, depending on your build system.  

---
## Manual JAR (Recommended for most users)

Download the latest **jloop-1.0.0.jar**, **jloop-1.0.0-sources.jar**, and **jloop-1.0.0-javadoc.jar** and place it into your project’s `libs/` folder.  

**Gradle**  
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation files('libs/jloop-1.0.0.jar')
    compileOnly files('libs/jloop/jloop-1.0.0-sources.jar')  
	compileOnly files('libs/jloop/jloop-1.0.0-javadoc.jar')
}
```

**Maven (local install)**  
Since JLoop isn’t on Maven Central, you can install it into your local Maven repository:  

```bash
mvn install:install-file     
-Dfile=jloop-1.0.0.jar     
-DgroupId=org.rabbittownsoftware     
-DartifactId=jloop     
-Dversion=1.0.0     
-Dpackaging=jar
```

Then include it in your `pom.xml`:  
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.rabbittownsoftware</groupId>
  <artifactId>jloop</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Attach Sources and Javadoc (Optional)

To get **inline documentation and source browsing** inside your IDE, download the extra JARs from the release:  

- `jloop-1.0.0-sources.jar`  
- `jloop-1.0.0-javadoc.jar`  

Attach them manually in your IDE:  

**IntelliJ IDEA**  
1. Right-click the dependency in the Project view.  
2. Select **Library Properties**.  
3. Attach the `-sources.jar` and `-javadoc.jar`.  

**Eclipse**  
1. Right-click the library under *Referenced Libraries*.  
2. Select **Properties → Javadoc Location**.  
3. Point to the `-javadoc.jar`.  
4. Do the same for **Source Attachment** with the `-sources.jar`.

## Option 3 – Build From Source (For contributors)

Clone the repo and build with Gradle:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rabbit-Town-Software/jloop.git
cd jloop
./gradlew build
```

This produces JARs under `build/libs/`, which you can then include in your project manually.
